				Immanuel Kant, (born April 22, 1724, Königsberg, Prussia [now Kaliningrad, Russia]—died February 12, 1804, Königsberg),
				German philosopher whose comprehensive and systematic work in epistemology (the theory of knowledge),
				ethics, and aesthetics greatly influenced all subsequent philosophy,
				especially the various schools of Kantianism and idealism.

			<h3>Background and early years</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Kant lived in the remote province where he was born for his entire life.
					His father, a saddler, was, according to Kant, a descendant of a Scottish immigrant, 
					although scholars have found no basis for this claim; his mother was remarkable for her character and natural intelligence. 
					Both parents were devoted followers of the Pietist branch of the Lutheran church, 
					which taught that religion belongs to the inner life expressed in simplicity and obedience to moral law. 
					The influence of their pastor made it possible for Kant—the fourth of nine children but the eldest surviving child—to obtain an education.</li>
				<li>
					At the age of eight Kant entered the Pietist school that his pastor directed. 
					This was a Latin school, and it was presumably during the eight and a half years he was there that Kant acquired his lifelong love for the Latin classics,
					especially for the naturalistic poet Lucretius. In 1740 he enrolled in the University of Königsberg as a theological student.
					But, although he attended courses in theology and even preached on a few occasions, he was principally attracted to mathematics and physics.
					Aided by a young professor who had studied Christian Wolff, a systematizer of rationalist philosophy, 
					and who was also an enthusiast for the science of Sir Isaac Newton, Kant began reading the work of the English physicist and, in 1744, 
					started his first book, Gedanken von der wahren Schätzung der lebendigen Kräfte (1746; Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces), 
					dealing with a problem concerning kinetic forces. Though by that time he had decided to pursue an academic career, 
					the death of his father in 1746 and his failure to obtain the post of under-tutor in one of the schools attached to the university compelled him to withdraw 
					and seek a means of supporting himself.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>The Critique of Pure Reason</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Critique of Pure Reason was the result of some 10 years of thinking and meditation. 
					Yet, even so, Kant published the first edition only reluctantly after many postponements; although convinced of the truth of its doctrine, 
					he was uncertain and doubtful about its exposition. His misgivings proved well founded, 
					and Kant complained that interpreters and critics of the work were badly misunderstanding it. 
					To correct these wrong interpretations of his thought, 
					he wrote the Prolegomena zu einer jeden künftigen Metaphysik die als Wissenschaft wird auftreten können (1783; 
					Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will be Able to Come Forward as Science) and brought out a second and revised edition of the first Critique in 1787.
					Controversy still continues regarding the merits of the two editions: 
					readers with a preference for an idealistic interpretation usually prefer the first edition, whereas those with a realistic view adhere to the second. 
					But with regard to difficulty and ease of reading and understanding, 
					it is generally agreed that there is little to choose between them. 
					Anyone on first opening either book finds it overwhelmingly difficult and impenetrably obscure.
				</li>
				<li>
					With this work, Kant proudly asserted that he had accomplished a Copernican revolution in philosophy. 
					Just as the founder of modern astronomy, Nicolaus Copernicus, 
					had explained the apparent movements of the stars by ascribing them partly to the movement of the observers, 
					so Kant had accounted for the application of the mind’s a priori principles to objects by demonstrating that the objects conform to the mind: 
					in knowing, it is not the mind that conforms to things but instead things that conform to the mind.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Last years of Immanuel Kant</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The critical philosophy was soon being taught in every important German-speaking university, 
						and young men flocked to Königsberg as a shrine of philosophy. 
						In some cases the Prussian government even undertook the expense of their support. Kant came to be consulted as an oracle on all kinds of questions, 
						including such subjects as the lawfulness of vaccination. Such homage did not interrupt Kant's regular habits. Scarcely five feet tall, with a deformed chest, 
						and suffering from weak health, he maintained throughout his life a severe regimen. 
						It was arranged with such regularity that people set their clocks according to his daily walk along the street named for him, 
						“The Philosopher's Walk.” Until old age prevented him, 
						he is said to have missed this regular appearance only on the occasion when Rousseau's Émile so engrossed him that for several days he stayed at home.
					</li>
					<li>
						From 1790 Kant's health began to decline seriously. He still had many literary projects but found it impossible to write more than a few hours a day. 
						The writings that he then completed consist partly of an elaboration of subjects not previously treated in any detail, 
						partly of replies to criticisms and to the clarification of misunderstandings. 
						With the publication in 1793 of his work Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft (Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone), 
						Kant became involved in a dispute with Prussian authorities on the right to express religious opinions. 
						The book was found to be altogether too rationalistic for orthodox taste. 
						He was charged with misusing his philosophy to the “distortion and depreciation of many leading and fundamental doctrines of sacred Scripture and Christianity”
						and was required by the government not to lecture or write anything further on religious subjects. 
						Kant agreed but privately interpreted the ban as a personal promise to the king, Frederick William II, 
						from which he felt himself to be released on the latter's death in 1797. At any rate, he returned to the forbidden subject in his last major essay, 
						“Der Streit der Fakultäten” (1798; “The Conflict of the Faculties”). 
						In 1797 Kant published Die Metaphysik der Sitten (The Metaphysics of Morals), 
						comprising Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Rechtslehre (The Philosophy of Law) and Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre (The Doctrine of Virtue). 
						The former was the major statement of his political philosophy, 
						which he also discussed in Zum ewigen Frieden (1795; Project for a Perpetual Peace) and in the essay 
						“Uber den Gemeinspruch: Das mag in der Theorie richtig sein, taugt aber nicht für die Praxis” (1793; “On the Old Saw: That May Be Right In Theory, 
						But It Won't Work in Practice”).
					</li>
					<li>
						After a gradual decline that was painful to his friends as well as to himself, 
						Kant died in Königsberg on February 12, 1804. His last words were “Es ist gut” (“It is good”). 
						His tomb in the cathedral was inscribed with the words (in German) “The starry heavens above me and the moral law within me,” 
						the two things that he declared in the conclusion of the second Critique “fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, 
						the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them.”
